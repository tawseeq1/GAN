# GAN
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images based on the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images, and the discriminator evaluates them to distinguish between real and fake images. </br>

**Features** </br>
* **Generator**: Creates images from random noise.
* **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake images.
* **Training**: Trains the GAN using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
* **Callbacks**: Saves generated images after each epoch.
